Operator Comparison

- By comparing ottoman and mongoose, ottoman has most of the operator functions compared to mongoose. ottoman does not support $push & $pull but both should have a workaround in ottoman using update

Things to note:
- operator $neq and $eq works for number but not for String in Ottoman
- Ottoman uses $not {$in} instead of $nin

Model Option Comparison

- Ottoman does not support the String validation of minLength and maxLength.
- Ottoman does not support uppercase/lowercase
- type: Buffer not supported in Ottoman
- type: Object is not support in Ottoman (no mixed type)
- While trying out the $gt, Ottoman is unable to compare the Date type as it stores the Date as a string (how to do date filter)
